Sorry for german descriptions in the files. I'll change this, if the files goes to final :)

# Plex-getMovies
Get Movies from Plex Mediaserver and save as HTML File to Disk

# delshow.py
deletes watched shows from disk an write it to a csv file for now. maybe i'll update this later with a option to write to mysql.
id o this, to have a overview about what i have watched.

# delmovie.py
does the same as delshow.py, but for testing it don't deletes the movie files yet. It moves to a backup folder. I'll change this 
after a testtime.
